# How to compile the project

        git clone git@github.com:solven-eu/cleanthat.git
        mvn install -Pfast -T 8

The `-Pfast` profile may be necessary to circumvent cleanthat depenending on itself to apply `spotless` on itself.

Once done (or re-done after a release), you can simply:

        mvn install

# Note for `mutator` contributors

## Bug with JavaParser

We regularly encounter bugs with `JavaParser` upstream dependency. In such case, with or without a workaround, it would be beneficial to report the case to JavaParser.

Many issues are related with `LexicalPreservingPrinter`.

Typical cases are:

- https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/issues/3924
- https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/issues/3936

## Unit-tests

Mutators are subject to many edge-cases, due to the complexity of syntaxes (including Java).

### Unmodified code

One can check a given code is not impacted with `@UnmodifiedMethod` over a nested-class. The nest-class represents a unit-case:

```
@UnmodifiedMethod
public static class CaseCollection {
    public Object pre(Collection<?> input) {
        return input.size() == 0;
    }
}
```

### Simple code comparison

On can check some code is modified as expected with `CompareMethods` over a nested-class. The nest-class represents a unit-case:

```
@CompareMethods
public static class CaseStringEqualsIgnoreCaseEmpty {
    public Object pre(String input) {
        return input.equalsIgnoreCase("");
    }

    public Object post(String input) {
        return input.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

## Code not compiling with Cleanthat own classpath

You may consider rules with advanced edge-case, requiring specific code which would not compile in `test` module classpath. It happens when testing code with a java language-level different from Cleanthat own language-level (e.g. a rule processing `JDK21` while cleanthat is compiled as `JDK11`).

One can rely on `@CompareCompilationUnitsAsResources`:

```
@CompareCompilationUnitsAsResources(
    pre =  "/source/do_not_format_me/UnnecessaryModifier/Issue807.java",
    post = "/source/do_not_format_me/UnnecessaryModifier/Issue807.java")
public static class Issue807 {
}
```

## Manual test over large code-bases

A given rule can be tested against a large set of codebases with https://github.com/solven-eu/cleanthat-showcases. See its README for more details.

# Notes for maintainers

## Additional mutator

Add you rule in `eu.solven.cleanthat.engine.java.refactorer.mutators.scanner.MutatorsScanner`.

## Generate documentation

Run `TestGenerateDocumentation`.

## Deploy into Production (AWS Lambda):

        git push origin master:deploy-prd

## Release a new version (and deploy jars to Sonatype m2central):

        mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform

### In case of failure

The release process may fail for various reasons:

- Sonatype timed-out

They, one would typically need to revert its local head, and force push master before the release. And delete the falsy tags:

        git tag -d v2.XX.RELEASE
        git push --delete origin v2.XX.RELEASE
